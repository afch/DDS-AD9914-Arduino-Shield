# DDS AD9914 / AD9915 Arduino Shield
DDS (Direct Digital Synthesis) Analog Devices AD9914/AD9915 Arduino Shield by GRA &amp; AFCH

DDS (Direct Digital Synthesis) Analog Devices AD9915 Arduino Shield by GRA &amp; AFCH <br/>
The difference between the two RF Shield Units is only in the maximum clocking frequency of the DDS core <br/>
In DDS AD9915 Shield Unit it is nominally 2.5 GHz and it can be overclocked to 3 GHz <br/>
In DDS AD9914 Shield Unit it is nominally higher than 3.5 GHz and can be overclocked to 4 GHz <br/>
The firmware is the same for AD9914 and AD9915 except for the inscription on the OLED screen, you need to change line 14 in the DisplayMenu.ino file to display.printin(F("DDS AD9914")); <br/>
